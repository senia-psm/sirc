 *    Parameters: <nickname>
 *    *( ( "+" / "-" ) *( "i" / "w" / "o" / "O" / "r" ) )
 *
 *    The user MODE's are typically changes which affect either how the
 *    client is seen by others or what 'extra' messages the client is sent.
 *
 *    A user MODE command MUST only be accepted if both the sender of the
 *    message and the nickname given as a parameter are both the same.  If
 *    no other parameter is given, then the server will return the current
 *    settings for the nick.
 *
 *       The available modes are as follows:
 *
 *            a - user is flagged as away;
 *            i - marks a users as invisible;
 *            w - user receives wallops;
 *            r - restricted user connection;
 *            o - operator flag;
 *            O - local operator flag;
 *            s - marks a user for receipt of server notices.
 *
 *    Additional modes may be available later on.
 *
 *    The flag 'a' SHALL NOT be toggled by the user using the MODE command,
 *    instead use of the AWAY command is REQUIRED.
 *
 *    If a user attempts to make themselves an operator using the "+o" or
 *    "+O" flag, the attempt SHOULD be ignored as users could bypass the
 *    authentication mechanisms of the OPER command.  There is no
 *    restriction, however, on anyone `deopping' themselves (using "-o" or
 *    "-O").
 *
 *    On the other hand, if a user attempts to make themselves unrestricted
 *    using the "-r" flag, the attempt SHOULD be ignored.  There is no
 *    restriction, however, on anyone `deopping' themselves (using "+r").
 *    This flag is typically set by the server upon connection for
 *    administrative reasons.  While the restrictions imposed are left up
 *    to the implementation, it is typical that a restricted user not be
 *    allowed to change nicknames, nor make use of the channel operator
 *    status on channels.
 *
 *    The flag 's' is obsolete but MAY still be used.

 *

 *    send messages to channels.  <msgtarget> is usually the nickname of
 *    the recipient of the message, or a channel name.
 *
 *    The <msgtarget> parameter may also be a host mask (#<mask>) or server
 *    mask ($<mask>).  In both cases the server will only send the PRIVMSG
 *    to those who have a server or host matching the mask.  The mask MUST
 *    have at least 1 (one) "." in it and no wildcards following the last
 *    ".".  This requirement exists to prevent people sending messages to
 *    "#*" or "$*", which would broadcast to all users.  Wildcards are the
 *    '*' and '?'  characters.  This extension to the PRIVMSG command is

 * 
 * 3.7.1 Kill message
 * 
 *       Command: KILL
 *    Parameters: <nickname> <comment>
 * 
 *    The KILL command is used to cause a client-server connection to be
 *    closed by the server which has the actual connection.  Servers
 *    generate KILL messages on nickname collisions.  It MAY also be
 *    available available to users who have the operator status.
 * 
 *    Clients which have automatic reconnect algorithms effectively make
 *    this command useless since the disconnection is only brief.  It does
 *    however break the flow of data and can be used to stop large amounts
 *    of 'flooding' from abusive users or accidents.  Abusive users usually
 *    don't care as they will reconnect promptly and resume their abusive
 *    behaviour.  To prevent this command from being abused, any user may
 *    elect to receive KILL messages generated for others to keep an 'eye'
 *    on would be trouble spots.
 * 
 *    In an arena where nicknames are REQUIRED to be globally unique at all
 *    times, KILL messages are sent whenever 'duplicates' are detected
 *    (that is an attempt to register two users with the same nickname) in
 *    the hope that both of them will disappear and only 1 reappear.
 * 
 *    When a client is removed as the result of a KILL message, the server
 *    SHOULD add the nickname to the list of unavailable nicknames in an
 *    attempt to avoid clients to reuse this name immediately which is
 *    usually the pattern of abusive behaviour often leading to useless
 *    "KILL loops".  See the "IRC Server Protocol" document [IRC-SERVER]
 *    for more information on this procedure.
 * 
 *    The comment given MUST reflect the actual reason for the KILL.  For
 *    server-generated KILLs it usually is made up of details concerning
 *    the origins of the two conflicting nicknames.  For users it is left
 *    up to them to provide an adequate reason to satisfy others who see
 *    it.  To prevent/discourage fake KILLs from being generated to hide
 *    the identify of the KILLer, the comment also shows a 'kill-path'
 *    which is updated by each server it passes through, each prepending
 *    its name to the path.

 * 
 *    NOTE:
 *    It is RECOMMENDED that only Operators be allowed to kill other users
 *    with KILL command.  This command has been the subject of many
 *    controversies over the years, and along with the above
 *    recommendation, it is also widely recognized that not even operators

 *    another but MUST NOT be accepted from any normal unknown clients.
 * 
 *    Only an ERROR message SHOULD be used for reporting errors which occur

 *    at the other end (which reports it to appropriate local users and
 *    logs) and to appropriate local users and logs.  It is not to be
 *    passed onto any other servers by a server if it is received from a
 *    server.
 * 
 *    The ERROR message is also used before terminating a client
 *    connection.
 *

/**
 * 4. Optional features
 * 
 *    This section describes OPTIONAL messages.  They are not required in a

 *    the absence of the feature, an error reply message MUST be generated
 *    or an unknown command error.  If the message is destined for another
 *    server to answer then it MUST be passed on (elementary parsing
 *    REQUIRED) The allocated numerics for this are listed with the

 *    From this section, only the USERHOST and ISON messages are available
 *    to services.
 * 
 * 4.1 Away
 * 
 *       Command: AWAY
 *    Parameters: [ <text> ]
 * 
 *    With the AWAY command, clients can set an automatic reply string for
 *    any PRIVMSG commands directed at them (not to a channel they are on).
 *    The server sends an automatic reply to the client sending the PRIVMSG
 *    command.  The only replying server is the one to which the sending
 *    client is connected to.
 * 
 *    The AWAY command is used either with one parameter, to set an AWAY
 *    message, or with no parameters, to remove the AWAY message.
 * 
 *    Because of its high cost (memory and bandwidth wise), the AWAY
 *    message SHOULD only be used for client-server communication.  A
 *    server MAY choose to silently ignore AWAY messages received from
 *    other servers.  To update the away status of a client across servers,
 *    the user mode 'a' SHOULD be used instead.  (See Section 3.1.5)
